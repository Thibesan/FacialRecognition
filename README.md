## FacialRecognition

A Python Facial Recognition Program using dlib and OpenCV to process Webcam video input frames and output accuracy-relative face-recognition data in visual interface in real time. 
The algorithm executes every other frame (30 fps) from the native 60 of the webcam and outputs match accuracy along with object data for matched individuals.
Can recognize individuals based on the facial structure in both realistic and creative works with an accuracy percentage.
If the Accuracy of the frame falls below 60%, the face will be deemed unrecognized and return unknown object data.
